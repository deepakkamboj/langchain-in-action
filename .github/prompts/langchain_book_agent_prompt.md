## Content Style Requirements

### Technical Writing Standards
- Use active voice and direct language
- Write in second person ("you will implement", "your agent will")
- Avoid marketing language or promotional content
- Focus on technical accuracy and practical utility
- Include specific version numbers and compatibility information

### Code Documentation Standards
```

"""
Module: langchain_agent_example.py
Purpose: Demonstrates multi-modal agent implementation
Requirements: langchain>=0.1.0, openai>=1.0.0
"""

import logging
from typing import Dict, List, Optional
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor
from langchain.tools import BaseTool

# Configure logging for production use

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(**name**)

class MultiModalAgent:
"""
Production-ready multi-modal LangChain agent implementation.

    Handles text, image, and audio processing through unified interface.
    Includes error handling, logging, and monitoring capabilities.
    """

    def __init__(self, model_name: str, api_key: str):
        """Initialize agent with specified model and credentials."""
        self.model_name = model_name
        self.api_key = api_key
        logger.info(f"Initializing agent with model: {model_name}")

```

### Diagram and Table Standards
- Include clear, technical architecture diagrams
- Provide comparative tables for different approaches
- Use consistent formatting and professional presentation
- Include sequence diagrams for complex workflows

## Quality Assurance

### Technical Accuracy
- All code must be tested and functional
- Version compatibility clearly specified
- Error handling implemented throughout
- Performance considerations documented

### Practical Value
- Each chapter must provide immediately applicable skills
- Code examples solve real-world problems
- Implementation exercises build practical expertise
- Professional-grade output suitable for production use

## Chapter Scope
Target 25-30 pages per chapter with:
- 40% hands-on code implementation
