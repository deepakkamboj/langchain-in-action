# Part VI: Observability with LangSmith

Welcome to **Part VI: Observability with LangSmith**, where you'll learn to debug, monitor, and evaluate your agents for production readiness using LangSmith's powerful tracing and evaluation capabilities.

## Production-Ready Agent Development

Building agents is one thing—ensuring they work reliably in production is another. Part VI teaches you the essential skills of agent observability: understanding what your agents are thinking, why they make certain decisions, and how to continuously improve their performance.

## What You'll Learn in Part VI

### [Chapter 13: Debugging and Tracing with LangSmith](./chapter13)

**Understanding Your Agent's Decision-Making Process**

- Set up comprehensive tracing for agent execution
- Visualize agent reasoning and decision paths
- Debug failed chains and analyze error patterns
- Compare agent runs for A/B testing
- Track token usage and costs across deployments

### [Chapter 14: Monitoring and Evaluation with LangSmith](./chapter14)

**Measuring and Improving Agent Performance**

- Create evaluation datasets for agent performance testing
- Implement automated testing pipelines
- Build real-time monitoring dashboards
- Set up anomaly detection and alerting
- Establish human-in-the-loop evaluation workflows

## Part VI Case Study: Production Agent Monitoring

You'll implement comprehensive observability for your healthcare agent:

- **Complete Tracing**: Every decision, tool call, and response tracked
- **Performance Metrics**: Latency, accuracy, and user satisfaction monitoring
- **Cost Analysis**: Token usage optimization and budget management
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated evaluation and regression testing
- **Incident Response**: Real-time alerting and diagnostic capabilities
