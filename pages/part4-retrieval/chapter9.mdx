# Chapter 9: Building Retrieval-Enhanced Agents

## Introduction

Turn your agent into a knowledge powerhouse. You'll learn to design and optimize RAG pipelines that retrieve, filter, and ground responses in factual data. Through real-world examples, you'll implement retrievers, semantic search, and failover logic for production reliability. By the end, you'll have a robust RAG system that speaks with context and confidence.

## What You Will Learn

- Understand principles behind RAG-based systems
- Set up and configure vector databases
- Implement different retriever and reranker types
- Build semantic search and context retrieval flows
- Manage token limits with smart context windows
- Chain retrievers and routers for better recall
- Handle failure and fallback within RAG pipelines
- Build complete production-ready RAG architectures

## Coming Soon

This chapter is currently being developed and will include:

- RAG pipeline diagrams
- Tabular method comparisons (FAISS, Pinecone, etc.)
- Annotated notebook walkthrough
- Troubleshooting guide tables
- Evaluation metrics and benchmarking templates

Readers will run a complete RAG workflow, explore failure modes using RAG Troubleshooting Checklist, and optimize accuracy/latency.
