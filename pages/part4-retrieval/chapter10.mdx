# Chapter 10: Fusing Knowledge Networks for Advanced Reasoning

## Introduction

Empower your agent with deep, connected intelligence. Combine graph queries, external APIs, and live search to create hybrid reasoning systems. You'll fuse multiple data sources, handle conflicting information, and maintain knowledge freshness. This chapter transforms your agent from a conversational tool into a decision-making assistant powered by connected context.

## What You Will Learn

- Integrate reasoning using knowledge graph systems
- Perform relationship traversal and knowledge discovery
- Combine vector and graph-based search methods
- Connect external APIs for real-time insights
- Integrate web search and live data feeds
- Manage knowledge freshness and version control
- Resolve conflicts across multiple data sources
- Design enterprise-level decision-making AI agents

## Coming Soon

This chapter is currently being developed and will include:

- Source fusion architecture diagrams
- Conflict resolution tables
- Annotated config and API code samples
- Sequence/flow diagrams for decision agents

Work through agent integration with multiple sources, configs, and practical decision-making scenarios.
