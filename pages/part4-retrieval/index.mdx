# Part IV: Knowledge & Retrieval

## Overview

This section focuses on building knowledge-powered agents that can retrieve, process, and reason with information from multiple sources. You'll learn to implement RAG systems and create hybrid reasoning architectures.

## Chapters in This Section

- **Chapter 9**: Building Retrieval-Enhanced Agents
- **Chapter 10**: Fusing Knowledge Networks for Advanced Reasoning

## Key Learning Outcomes

By the end of this section, you'll be able to:

- Understand principles behind RAG-based systems
- Set up and configure vector databases
- Implement different retriever and reranker types
- Build semantic search and context retrieval flows
- Integrate reasoning using knowledge graph systems
- Combine vector and graph-based search methods
- Connect external APIs for real-time insights
- Design enterprise-level decision-making AI agents
