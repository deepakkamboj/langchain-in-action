# Chapter 11: Creating Autonomous Agents that Perform Real-World Tasks

## Introduction

Make your agent truly useful by letting it take action. You'll implement OpenAI function calling, custom toolkits, and multi-tool orchestration for real-world tasks like querying APIs or updating databases. Learn to manage errors, security, and sandboxing as your agent safely executes code. By the end, your AI won't just answer-it will do.

## What You Will Learn

- Understand tool abstraction and calling mechanisms
- Implement OpenAI function calls within LangChain
- Create and register custom reusable toolkits
- Apply selection logic for multiple tool execution
- Integrate REST, GraphQL, and gRPC-based APIs
- Perform secure database operations via agents
- Handle errors and implement retry mechanisms
- Build sandboxed, secure multi-tool agent workflows

## Coming Soon

This chapter is currently being developed and will include:

- Architecture diagrams for tool workflows
- Table: API types and tool abstractions
- Complete code demos for tool/sandbox integration: agent calls 2-3 tools to complete a task (e.g., fetch weather + analyze sentiment + save to DB)
- Logging/error-handling flowcharts
- Multi-tool workflow sequence diagrams

Hands-on labs with multi-tool agent workflows will help readers debug and sandbox agents effectively.
