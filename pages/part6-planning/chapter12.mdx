# Chapter 12: Planning, Collaboration, and Evaluating Autonomous Agents

## Introduction

Now it's time to build the complete system. This final chapter ties everything together with planning, self-correction, and multi-agent collaboration. You'll construct a planner-executor system that decomposes tasks, coordinates agents, and measures outcomes. The capstone project will challenge you to evaluate, optimize, and deploy a fully autonomous LangChain agent-your own AI in action.

## What You Will Learn

- Understand planner-executor architecture design principles
- Implement task decomposition and execution planning
- Build planner agents like BabyAGI and AutoGPT
- Develop autonomous execution and self-correction logic
- Orchestrate collaboration between multiple specialized agents
- Manage context handoffs across complex workflows
- Automate response strategies for dynamic scenarios
- Evaluate agent performance using measurable metrics

## Coming Soon

This chapter is currently being developed and will include:

- Planner/Executor system diagrams
- Side-by-side logic tables
- Complete code for the capstone system
- Evaluation metrics/criteria tables
- Production hardening checklists

Capstone multi-agent planner exercise will challenge readers to design, execute, and evaluate advanced planning scenarios.
