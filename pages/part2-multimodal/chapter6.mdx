# Chapter 6: Building Conversational Agents with Voice Intelligence

## Introduction

Give your agents a voice-and ears. This chapter walks you through building voice-first workflows using Whisper, Azure Speech, and TTS models. You'll build a live speech-to-text and text-to-speech agent, detect emotion in voice data, and deploy a real-time assistant. The result: a conversational, multilingual voice agent that feels almost human.

## What You Will Learn

- Use Whisper and Azure for speech recognition
- Extract key features from audio signals
- Implement text-to-speech and speech synthesis
- Build end-to-end voice-first agent workflows
- Enable real-time conversational audio pipelines
- Detect sentiment and emotion from voice
- Support multilingual agents with translation models
- Build voice-enabled telemedicine AI assistants

## Coming Soon

This chapter is currently being developed and will include:

- Audio pipeline block diagrams
- Table of audio framework/model capabilities
- Annotated notebook code: ASR to TTS
- Colab-ready project for live testing
- Error/latency analysis tables

Readers will implement a live audio/voice agent assistant with emphasis on latency and error handling.
