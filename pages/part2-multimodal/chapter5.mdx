# Chapter 5: Building Vision-Enabled Agents with Visual Intelligence

## Introduction

Teach your agent to see the world. You'll integrate cutting-edge vision models like CLIP and GPT-4V, extract insights from images and video, and even process real-world visual data. Through guided projects, you'll apply OCR, image understanding, and vision APIs in real use cases like healthcare diagnostics. By the end, your agent won't just read text-it will truly perceive.

## What You Will Learn

- Integrate advanced models like CLIP, GPT-4V
- Analyze and interpret images contextually
- Implement OCR for structured text extraction
- Use external vision APIs for automation
- Build text-to-image and image-to-text systems
- Process and analyze video data streams
- Apply vision models in medical case studies
- Design complete vision-driven agent architectures

## Coming Soon

This chapter is currently being developed and will include:

- Architecture diagram for vision agent flow
- Table of compatible vision models/APIs
- Ready-to-run notebook with code and image data
- Case study: annotated step diagrams
- Data reproducibility checklist
- Example code for open-source pipelines

Ready-to-run agent pipelines for medical or retail image analysis will be showcased with opportunities for experimentation with data sets.
