# Part II: Multi-Modal Integration

Welcome to **Part II: Multi-Modal Integration**, where you'll transform your agents from text-only systems into sophisticated multi-modal intelligences capable of processing images, audio, video, and sensor data alongside natural language.

## The Multi-Modal Revolution

Traditional AI agents operated in a single modality—typically text. But the real world is inherently multi-modal. Humans communicate through speech, gestures, facial expressions, and images. Documents contain charts, diagrams, and photos. Real-time applications need to process video streams, audio calls, and sensor data.

Part II teaches you to build agents that understand and interact with the world through all these channels simultaneously.

## What You'll Learn in Part II

**Key Outcomes:**

- Process complex documents with embedded images and charts

### [Chapter 6: Audio Processing and Voice Integration](./chapter6)

**Giving Your Agents a Voice**

- Integrate speech recognition systems (Whisper, Azure Speech, AssemblyAI)
- Extract emotional context from voice prosody, pitch, and pacing
- Build voice-first agent interfaces with natural conversation flow
- Implement real-time audio stream processing
- Create multi-lingual voice support with translation capabilities

**Key Outcomes:**

- Build conversational agents that understand emotional context
- Create voice-enabled telemedicine consultation systems
- Implement real-time audio analysis for emergency response
