# Chapter 2: Modular LangChain Architecture Patterns

## Overview

In this chapter, you'll master the art of building scalable, maintainable agent systems through modular architecture patterns. You'll learn to design complex workflows using LangChain Expression Language (LCEL), create sophisticated routing logic, and build reusable component libraries that can grow with your applications.
