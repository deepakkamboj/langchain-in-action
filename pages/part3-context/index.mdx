# Part III: Context and Memory

Welcome to **Part III: Context and Memory**, where you'll transform your multi-modal agents into truly intelligent systems that remember, learn, and adapt their behavior based on context and emotional intelligence.

## The Intelligence Layer

While Parts I and II gave your agents the ability to reason and perceive through multiple modalities, Part III adds the crucial intelligence layer: the ability to maintain context across conversations, remember past interactions, and adapt behavior based on emotional and contextual cues.

This is where your agents evolve from reactive systems to proactive, empathetic assistants that understand not just what users say, but how they feel and what they need based on context.

## What You'll Learn in Part III

### [Chapter 7: Memory Systems for Stateful Agents](./chapter7)

**Building Agents That Remember and Learn**

- Implement sophisticated memory architectures (short-term, long-term, episodic, semantic)
- Build vector-based memory systems for semantic recall
- Create knowledge graphs for relational memory
- Design hybrid memory systems for complex applications
- Implement memory retrieval strategies and relevance scoring

### [Chapter 8: Emotional Context Detection and Adaptive Responses](./chapter8)

**Adding Emotional Intelligence to Your Agents**

- Build multi-modal emotion detection systems
- Implement adaptive response strategies based on emotional state
- Create escalation protocols for crisis situations
- Design empathetic agent personas for healthcare and support
- Build emotion-aware conversation flows

## Part III Case Study: Empathetic Healthcare Agent

You'll build a comprehensive healthcare agent that demonstrates advanced context and memory capabilities:

- **Patient Memory**: Long-term patient history with medical context
- **Emotional Intelligence**: Real-time emotion detection and adaptive responses
- **Crisis Detection**: Automatic escalation for mental health emergencies
- **Contextual Adaptation**: Personalized communication based on patient profile
- **Multi-Session Continuity**: Seamless conversation across multiple interactions
