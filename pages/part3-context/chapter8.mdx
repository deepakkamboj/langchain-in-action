# Chapter 8: Designing Emotion-Aware Agents

## Introduction

Build empathy into intelligence. This chapter explores how agents can detect emotion, sense tone, and adjust their responses dynamically. Through practical code labs, you'll build sentiment-aware and emotion-sensitive prompts that respond with understanding. Whether it's de-escalating frustration or recognizing joy, your AI will learn to feel before it replies.

## What You Will Learn

- Understand emotional intelligence in AI systems
- Train sentiment analysis and emotion classifiers
- Detect emotions across multiple data modalities
- Design emotion-aware and context-sensitive prompts
- Generate adaptive and empathetic agent responses
- Simulate real-world emotion detection scenarios
- Implement crisis management using adaptive logic
- Build emotionally aware conversational agent prototypes

## Coming Soon

This chapter is currently being developed and will include:

- Table: Emotion/sentiment classification tools
- Annotated code for prompt adaptation
- Example dialog sequence diagrams
- Crisis handling logic illustrated
- Practical template library for context-aware prompts

Interactive code and scenario walkthroughs (e.g., frustrated user) will emphasize practical exercises over theory.
