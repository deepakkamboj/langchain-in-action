# Chapter 7: Developing Context-Aware Agents with Persistent Memory

## Introduction

What separates smart agents from forgetful ones? Memory. Here, you'll implement short- and long-term memory using buffers, summaries, vector stores, and knowledge graphs. With hands-on examples, you'll teach agents to recall past interactions and adapt responses intelligently. By the end, your agent will have a working memory-and a personality that evolves with context.

## What You Will Learn

- Understand short-term and long-term memory
- Implement conversation buffers for context tracking
- Build summary memory for dialogue compression
- Apply entity memory for dynamic reference storage
- Integrate vector stores for memory retrieval
- Use knowledge graphs to link relationships
- Implement hybrid memory combining multiple approaches
- Design adaptive memory systems for intelligent agents

## Coming Soon

This chapter is currently being developed and will include:

- Architecture diagram for memory systems
- Table comparing memory strategies
- Runnable retrieval/hybrid example code
- Sequence diagram of conversation state
- Diagrams showing state transitions

Code demos and diagrams for all major strategies will be provided. Readers will learn to combine multiple memory methods for advanced dialog capabilities.
